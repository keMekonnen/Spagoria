Spagoria 
--

Ever wanted to process large amounts of data, but didnt have the computing power to do so?

Ever wanted to host a blockchain, a mmorpg, or an API?

Now the answer is obviously cloud proccessing, right? AWS or Google Cloud come to mind as options -but who really likes them anyway? They are greedy and only work to profit themselves; destroying land for server farms, maxing out the earths resources to meet our demand.

We *need* to change this.

Spagoria means to be a solution. The idea is simple: create a way for people to use their idle machines to run processes for everybody else. This requires no additional infrastructure, just willing participants.

Spagoria will be a hybrid p2p network based app that people can purchase computing power from. The money will be given fullly and absolutely to the nodes running the requested processes, to incentivise work to keep being done.

The project is intended to be written in python, extensivelly utilising the socket module, but we are still at the very early stages of this project so other alternatives can be explored
